# Welcome to [Your Live Project]

To ensure smooth collaboration, we will follow a structured development workflow. Please read this guide to understand how we work with the `develop` branch.

## Working on the `develop` Branch

### Branch Structure

Our repository has the following branches:

- `main`: The main branch that represents our production-ready code.
- `develop`: The development branch where new features and bug fixes are integrated before being merged into `main`.

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Clone Your Repository**: Clone to your local development environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git

   On your local development environment before you start working on your assigned task do the following command:


   1. git checkout develop
   2. git pull origin develop
   3. git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

   -- Then start working on your task.
   -- Once you are done working on your task do the following command:

   4. git add "file name"
   5. git commit -m "useful comit message"
   6. git push origin feature/your-feature-name

   -- Then go on github to create a pull request and inform any of the SA to review and merge your work.
